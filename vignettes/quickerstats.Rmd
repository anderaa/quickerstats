## Introduction
The USDA's National Agricultural Statistics Service collects a wide variety of
data on US agriculture. They maintain a web tool (Quick Stats, see 
https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/) and an API 
(see https://quickstats.nass.usda.gov/api) for accessing the data. Both of the
existing tools for pulling data are cumbersome for many users due to their 
design and the variety of data available. The goal of quickerstats is to provide 
a tool for pulling data that is easier to use. The package does this in two
ways:

* Provide a search tool. An important parameter of the Quick Stats is 
'short_desc' (called Data Item in the web tool), which is a concatenation six 
other parameters (commodity_desc, class_desc, prodn_practice_desc, 
util_practice_desc, statisticcat_desc, and unit_desc). A typical workflow would 
be to drill down into each of these categories to build the desired short_desc 
string. The problem is that the available options for each successive parameter 
depend on the which values have already been chosen. Therefore, it is easiest to 
simply search the available short_desc strings for what you want. Since there 
are so many short_desc options, quickerstats provides a search function so you 
can find what you want.

* Provide easy to use functions for pulling state and county data. Most users 
will be pulling state or county-level data. We streamline the workflow by 
providing functionality for only these two options (using FIPS codes). Users can 
access  a particular data item for a single state or all states. Additionally, 
users can access a data item for all counties in the country, all counties in a 
state, or a single county.

## Installation

```
install.packages('quickerstats')
library('quickerstats')
```

## Search for a data item

Search for a data item like this:
```
search_data_items(search_terms=c('corn', 'harvested'), exclude=c('sweet'))
```
This will give you a list of data items that contain all of the search terms
and none of the exclude terms.

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```
